# Supplementary information: "Development of thermodynamically-consistent machine-learning Equations of State: Application to the Mie fluid"

This repository is part of the supplementary information of the article *["Development of thermodynamically-consistent machine-learning Equations of State: Application to the Mie fluid"](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0146634)* by Gustavo Chaparro and Erich A. MÃ¼ller. This article introduces an artificial neural network (ANN) based equation of state for the Mie fluid **, FE-ANN EoS**. 

The Mie potential is described as follows:

$$ U^{Mie} = \mathcal{C}_{Mie} \epsilon \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{\lambda_r} -  \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{\lambda_a} \right], \quad \mathcal{C}_{Mie} = \frac{\lambda_r}{\lambda_r- \lambda_a} \left( \frac{\lambda_r}{\lambda_a}\right)^{\frac{\lambda_a}{\lambda_r - \lambda_a}} $$ 

Here, $\epsilon$ represents the potential well depth, $\sigma$ is the effective monomer diameter, $r$ is the centre-to-centre distance between two Mie monomers, and $\lambda_r$ and $\lambda_a$ are the repulsive and attractive exponent, respectively.

The FE-ANN EoS models the Helmholtz free energy of the Mie fluid as follows:


$$ A^{res} = ANN(\alpha_{vdw}, \rho, 1/T) - ANN(\alpha_{vdw}, \rho=0, 1/T) $$

Where, $A^{res}$ is the dimensionless residual Helmholtz free energy, $\rho$ is the dimensionless density, $T$ is the dimensionless temperature and $\alpha_{vdw}$ is defined a the Mie fluid as follows:

$$ \alpha_{vdw} = \mathcal{C}_{Mie} \left[ \left(\frac{1}{\lambda_a-3} \right) - \left(\frac{1}{\lambda_r-3} \right) \right]$$

This model has been trained using thermophysical properties of the Mie fluid that include first-order derivative properties such as the compressibility factor ( $Z$ ) and the internal energy ( $U$ ), and second-order derivative properties such as the isobaric heat capacity ( $C_V$ ), the thermal pressure coefficient ( $\gamma_V$ ), the isothermal compressibility ( $\rho\kappa_T$ ), thermal expansion coefficient ( $\alpha_P$ ), adiabatic index ( $\gamma$ ) and the Joule-Thomson coefficient ( $\mu_{JT}$ ).


## Use of the FE-ANN EoS

The saved model is located in the [``fe-ann-eos``](./fe-ann-eos) folder. The model can be loaded using TensorFlow.
