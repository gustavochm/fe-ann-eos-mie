# Supplementary information: Thermodynamically-consistent machine-learning based Equation of State for the Mie fluid

This repository is part of the supplemetary information of the article *"Thermodynamically-consistent machine-learning based Equation of State for the Mie fluid" (Submitted to Journal of Physical Chemistry B)* by Gustavo Chaparro and Erich A. MÃ¼ller. This article introduces an artificial neural network (ANN) based equation of state for the Mie fluid **(FE-ANN EoS)**, this EoS is formulated as follows:

$$ A^{res} = ANN(\alpha_{vdw}, \rho, 1/T) - ANN(\alpha_{vdw}, \rho=0.0, 1/T) $$

Where, $A^{res}$ is the dimensionless residual Helmholtz free energy, $\rho$ is the dimensionless density, $T$ is the dimensionless temperature and $\alpha_{vdw}$ is defined a the Mie fluid as follows:

$$ \alpha_{vdw} = \mathcal{C}_{Mie} \left[ \left(\frac{1}{\lambda_a-3} \right) - \left(\frac{1}{\lambda_r-3} \right) \right], \qquad \mathcal{C}_{Mie} = \frac{\lambda_r}{\lambda_r- \lambda_a} \left( \frac{\lambda_r}{\lambda_r}\right)^{\frac{\lambda_a}{\lambda_r - \lambda_a}} $$

This model has been trained using thermophysical properties of the Mie fluid that include first-order derivative properties such as the compressibility factor ($Z$) and the internal energy ($U$), and second-order derivative properties such as the isobaric heat capacity ($C_V$), the thermal pressure coefficient ($\gamma_V$), the isothermal compressibility ($\rho\kappa_T$), thermal expansion coefficient ($\alpha_P$), adibatic index ($\gamma$) and the Joule-Thomson coefficient ($\mu_{JT}$).


## Use of the FE-ANN EoS

The saved model is found located at the [fe-ann-eos](./fe-ann-eos) folder. The model can be loaded using tensorflow.

The following examples of use of the FE-ANN EoS are provided in the [examples](./examples) folder.

1. Computing 1st and 2nd order derivative properties with the FE-ANN EoS.
2. Computing fluid phase equilibria with the FE-ANN EoS.
