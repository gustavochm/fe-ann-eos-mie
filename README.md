This repository is part of the supplemetary information of the article *"Thermodynamically-consistent machine-learning based Equation of State for the Mie fluid" (Submitted to Journal of Physical Chemistry B)* by Gustavo Chaparro and Erich A. MÃ¼ller. This article introduces an artificial neural network (ANN) based equation of state for the Mie fluid **(FE-ANN EoS)**, this EoS is formulated as follows:

$$ A^{*, res} = ANN(\alpha_{vdw}, \rho^*, 1/T^*) - ANN(\alpha_{vdw}, \rho^*=0.0, 1/T^*) $$

Where, $A^{*, res}$ is the dimensionless residual Helmholtz free energy, $\rho^*$ is the dimensionless density, $T^*$ is the dimensionless temperature and $\alpha_{vdw}$ if defined for the Mie fluid as follows:

$$ \alpha_{vdw} = \mathcal{C}_{Mie} \left[ \left(\frac{1}{\lambda_a-3} \right) - \left(\frac{1}{\lambda_r-3} \right) \right], \qquad \mathcal{C}_{Mie} = \frac{\lambda_r}{\lambda_r- \lambda_a} \left( \frac{\lambda_r}{\lambda_r}\right)^{\frac{\lambda_a}{\lambda_r - \lambda_a}} $$

This model has been trained using derivative information of the Mie
